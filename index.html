        <p>My favorite hobby is playing video games. I play games like Roblox, Minecraft, and Mario. I always play games after finishing my homework. In Roblox, I'm good at obbies and doing trick jumps. My mom always makes me turn off the computer because I spend too much time on the computer playing games. I'm always doing homework for computer class but she always thinks I'm playing games. I love to play games with my siblings because it's very fun but I like to play with my sister more then my brother. Playing video games is actually good for you becuase it helps your imagination and creativity. It also makes you more social and improves hand-eye co-ordination and fine motor skills. </p>
